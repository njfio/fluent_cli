## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic MCP Agent Usage
```bash
# Run an MCP-enabled agent
fluent openai agent-mcp \
  --engine openai \
  --task "Read the README.md file and summarize its contents" \
  --servers "filesystem:mcp-server-filesystem,git:mcp-server-git" \
  --config config.yaml
```

### Programmatic Usage
```rust
use fluent_agent::agent_with_mcp::AgentWithMcp;
use fluent_agent::memory::SqliteMemoryStore;
use fluent_agent::reasoning::LLMReasoningEngine;

// Create agent with MCP capabilities
let memory = Arc::new(SqliteMemoryStore::new("agent_memory.db")?);
let reasoning = Box::new(LLMReasoningEngine::new(engine));
let agent = AgentWithMcp::new(memory, reasoning);

// Connect to MCP servers
agent.connect_to_mcp_server(
    "filesystem".to_string(),
    "mcp-server-filesystem",
    &["--stdio"]
).await?;

// Execute intelligent tasks
let result = agent.execute_task_with_mcp(
    "Analyze the project structure and generate a report"
).await?;
```

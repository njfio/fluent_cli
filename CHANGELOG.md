## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-19 - Major Architecture Refactoring

### 🎉 Major Release - Complete Transformation to Modular Architecture

This release represents a complete transformation of Fluent CLI from a monolithic structure to a modern, secure, modular, and production-ready codebase.

### Added
- **🏗️ Modular Command Architecture**: Complete refactoring into focused command handlers
  - `fluent agent` - Interactive and agentic mode command handler
  - `fluent pipeline` - Pipeline execution with enhanced configuration
  - `fluent mcp` - Model Context Protocol server and client integration
  - `fluent neo4j` - Neo4j database integration with natural language queries
  - Backward compatible direct engine commands
- **🔒 Enhanced Security Features**:
  - Secure frontend with rate limiting (30 requests/minute)
  - Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
  - Command sandboxing with timeouts
  - Protection against injection attacks (SQL, command, XSS)
  - Secure temporary file handling with automatic cleanup
- **🛠️ Quality Assurance Tools**:
  - Security audit script with 15 comprehensive checks
  - Code quality assessment with 15 quality metrics
  - Automated vulnerability scanning
  - Performance and maintainability analysis
- **🧪 Comprehensive Testing Framework**:
  - 5 unit tests for modular architecture
  - 12 integration tests for end-to-end validation
  - Structured test organization with data and scripts
  - 100% test pass rate maintained
- **📁 Organized Documentation Structure**:
  - `docs/analysis/` - Code review and analysis documents
  - `docs/guides/` - User and development guides
  - `docs/implementation/` - Implementation status
  - `docs/security/` - Security documentation
  - `docs/testing/` - Testing strategies and documentation
- **String Replace Editor Tool**: Advanced file editing capabilities with surgical precision
  - Multiple occurrence modes (First, Last, All, Indexed)
  - Line range targeting for precise edits
  - Dry run previews for safe operation planning
  - Automatic timestamped backup creation
  - Comprehensive security validation and path restrictions
  - Case sensitivity control
  - Integration with agent tool registry

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Transformed monolithic 1,600+ line function into focused modules
- **Command Structure**: Implemented consistent CommandHandler trait pattern
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling with CommandResult type
- **Security**: Multi-layer security validation and sandboxing
- **Performance**: Maintained fast CLI startup times (<5 seconds)
- **Tool System**: Upgraded from experimental to production-ready status
- **Documentation**: Complete reorganization and comprehensive updates

### Fixed
- **Compilation**: Resolved all compiler warnings and errors
- **Dead Code**: Removed unused code and imports
- **Memory Management**: Fixed potential memory leaks and improved patterns
- **Error Messages**: Enhanced error handling and graceful failure
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 100% test pass rate

### Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation against malicious input
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Command Sandboxing**: Isolated execution with restricted permissions
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Secure file operations
- **Environment Isolation**: Restricted subprocess execution environment

### Removed
- **Unused Files**: Cleaned up deprecated and unused files
- **Test Artifacts**: Removed stray test files and build artifacts
- **Documentation Duplication**: Consolidated redundant documentation

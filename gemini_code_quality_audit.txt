I will start by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the entire Rust codebase, focusing on the seven key areas you've outlined. I'll then compile the findings into a prioritized, actionable list and save it to `gemini_code_quality_audit.md`.

First, I need to get a complete overview of all the Rust source files in the project.I've read the first 20 files. I'll read the remaining files to get a complete picture of the codebase.I have now reviewed all the Rust source files. I will now proceed with the analysis and generate the `gemini_code_quality_audit.md` file.
